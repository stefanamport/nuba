The 'initialImport' folder contains files related to the initial import for the firebase database.

All information about food is downloaded from here:
Federal Department of Home Affairs FDHA
Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office FSVO
http://www.naehrwertdaten.ch/

The format of the original csv data was manually adjusted to fit our needs (see generic_food_prepared.csv).
The data to be imported into the firebase database is included in food.database.ts.

The data included in food.database.ts was generated with the tool csvtojson:
- install csvtojson: https://www.npmjs.com/package/csvtojson
- command line: csvtojson generic_food_prepared.csv > converted.json
- copy paste output from converted.json to food.database.ts

As this data is not expected to change the conversion of csv to json is not fully automated.

When FirebaseImportService is executed the data in food.database.ts is imported to the firebase database.
